----

### TCP

- TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol
- TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network
- TCP is connection-oriented, and a connection between client and server is established before data can be sent

----

### 3-way handshake

- 3 steps to initiate a connection
  - SYN (synchronized)
  - SYN/ACK (synchronize / acknowledge)
  - ACK (acknowleged)

----

### UDP

- UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol
- Uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms

----

### IPv4

- 32-bits address
- From 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
- Associated with a subnet mask to be able to identify a machine and the network associated with this machine
- For example
  - 192.168.0.1 is the IP address
  - 255.255.255.0 is the mask address

----

### Subnets

- Logical division of an IP network
- Routing prefix expressed in CIDR notation
- Followed by a / and ending with the bit-length of the prefix
- For example
  - 198.51.100.0/24
  - Addresses from 198.51.100.0 to 198.51.100.255 belongs to this network

----

### CIDR

Classless Inter-Domain Routing

- Class A : 10.0.0.0/8
  - 16 777 216 IPs available
- Class B : 172.16.0.0/16
  - 1 048 576 IPs available
- Class C : 192.168.0.0/24
  - 65 536 IPs available

----

### CIDR

Classless Inter-Domain Routing

- Class D : 224.0.0.0/32
  - Multicast
- Class E : 240.0.0.0/32
  - Reserved

----

### Static vs Dynamic (DHCP)

- The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a clientâ€“server architecture

----

----

### Ports

- A port is a communication endpoint
- A port number is always associated with an IP address of a host and the type of transport protocol used for communication (TCP or UDP)
- Specific port numbers are reserved to identify specific services
- Port numbers lower than 1024 identify the historically most commonly used services
- Higher-numbered ports are available for general use by applications

----

### Common port numbers

| Number | Assignment |
|---|---|
| 20 | File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Data Transfer |
| 21 | File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Command Control |
| 22 | Secure Shell (SSH) Secure Login |
| 25 | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) email delivery |

----

### Common port numbers

| Number | Assignment |
|---|---|
| 53 | Domain Name System (DNS) service |
| 80 | Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used in the World Wide Web |
| 443 | HTTP Secure (HTTPS) HTTP over TLS/SSL |

----

### Firewalls

- A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules
- Operates on layer 4 of the OSI model

----

### Firewalls

- Packet filter
  - The first reported type of network firewall is called a packet filter, which inspect packets transferred between computers. The firewall maintains an access control list which dictates what packets will be looked at and what action should be applied

----

### Firewalls

- Connection tracking
  - Second-generation firewalls perform the work of their first-generation predecessors but also maintain knowledge of specific conversations between endpoints by remembering which port number the two IP addresses are using

----

----

### DMZ

- A DMZ is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization's external-facing services to an untrusted, usually larger, network such as the Internet
- Add an additional layer of security to an organization's local area network (LAN)

----

### DMZ : Single firewall

----

### DMZ : Dual firewalls

----

### DNS

- The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network
- Associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities

----

### DNS

- For example
  - A record : associate a DNS name to an IPv4
  - AAAA record : associate a DNS name to an IPv6
  - CNAME record : Alias of one name to another
  - NS record : Delegates a DNS zone to use the given authoritative name servers
  - MX record : Maps a domain name to a list of message transfer agents for that domain

----

### NAT

- **Network address translation (NAT)** is a method of mapping an IP address space into another
- One Internet-routable IP address of a NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network

----

### VPN / MPLS

- A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks
- The benefits of a VPN include increases in functionality, security, and management of the private network
- Operates on layer 2 or 3

----

### VPN / MPLS

- Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) often overlays VPNs, often with quality-of-service control over a trusted delivery network
- L2TP which is a standards-based replacement, and a compromise taking the good features from each, for two proprietary VPN protocols

----

----

### Router

- A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks
- A router is connected to two or more data lines from different IP networks

----

### Routing (BGP)

- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet
